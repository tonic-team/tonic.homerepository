# On own GIN instance

Once you install your own GIN instance, you need to get the template in there for the tonic bot to find it and make sure everything is working.

## Use the template without submodules

- Add a repository (+ button)
- choose import repository
- in the clone address, enter the template address here on github
- the owner, use `G-Node`(you had to create this organisation for the help wiki)
- for the name, use `template_1`

- The tonic bot json will need to have `"templaterepo":	"G-Node/template_1"`

## Use the template with submodules

In construction !!
