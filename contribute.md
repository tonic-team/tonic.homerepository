# Contribute to the GIN-Tonic project and the standard folder structure

We are looking forward for contributions coming from every corners of the research landscape, any discipline and any stakeholder should feel welcome to participate in this project.

## Standard folder structure

Please use [github issues in the Research Project folder Template](https://github.com/tonic-team/Tonic-Research-Project-Template/issues) to discuss changes and ameliorations.
You may also propose changes using Pull requests if you feel comfortable with that workflow, and you are welcome to fork the project to get your own flavor of the template
(feel free to ask for help).

Decisions to make changes will be made during online calls where all contributors will be invited.

## Implementation and documentation

Please refer to the repository own contribution details, these require more technical skills to modify, but you are welcome to give feedback and whishes by opening issues.
