We are glad you are looking into GIN-Tonic and hope this project will help you. 

The Tonic project aims to develop a common file structure for (neuro-)scientific research projects, as well as software to facilitate its use. Our ultimate goal is to facilitate data, project and lab management using an open source approach and technologically relatively simple approach. The project was described [in a blog post](https://genr.eu/wp/towards-a-standardized-research-folder-structure/) and several [presenation available online](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2DQtGVabjQ) or more recent presentation slide called [Using GIN-Tonic to structure and write research Data](https://nfdi-neuro.de/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Colomb_GinTonic.pdf). 

The project consists of the production of a [standard folder structure for research projects](https://github.com/tonic-team/Tonic-Research-Project-Template), and its impelementation in GIN via the [tonic bot](https://github.com/tonic-team/tonic.code) written in GO. The tools are documented via a  [website](https://gin-tonic.netlify.app/), which is developed using hugo [here](https://github.com/tonic-team/tonic.site).
